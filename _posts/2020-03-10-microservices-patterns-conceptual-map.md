During the first months of the year, I've been reading the book [**Microservices Patterns**](https://microservices.io/book) written by **Chris Richardson**. 

In my opinion, even if you are not familiar with microservices or you already use microservices it will help you to understand the pros and cons of using microservices as architectural style. The book explains well-known patterns about how to do microservices properly that you can benefit of.

I've created this conceptual map collecting the most important ideas and patterns explained in the book.

[Cmap](https://cmap.ihmc.us/) is the tool I've used to model the map.
